"""Core immutable ECS `State` dataclass.

This module defines the frozen :class:`State` object that represents the
entire game / simulation snapshot at a single turn. All systems are pure
functions that take a previous ``State`` plus inputs (e.g. an ``Action``) and
return a *new* ``State``; no mutation happens in-place. This makes the engine
deterministic, easy to test, and friendly to functional style reducers.

Design notes:

* Component stores are **persistent maps** (``pyrsistent.PMap``) keyed by
    ``EntityID``. Absence of a key means the entity does not currently possess
    that component.
* Effect components (Immunity, Phasing, Speed, TimeLimit, UsageLimit) are
    referenced by :class:`grid_universe.components.properties.Status` which
    holds ordered ``effect_ids``. Several systems (status tick, GC) walk those
    references.
* The ``prev_position`` and ``trail`` auxiliary stores are populated by
    dedicated systems to enable path‑based effects (e.g. trail rendering or
    damage-on-cross mechanics).
* ``win`` / ``lose`` flags are mutually exclusive terminal markers. The
    reducer short‑circuits on terminal states.

Google‑style docstrings throughout the codebase refer back to this structure;
see :mod:`grid_universe.step` for how the reducer orchestrates systems.

    Instances are *value objects*; every transition creates a new ``State``.
    Only include persistent / serializable data here (no open handles or
    caches). Systems should be pure functions that accept and return ``State``.

    Attributes:
        width (int): Grid width in tiles.
        height (int): Grid height in tiles.
        move_fn (MoveFn): Movement candidate function used to resolve move actions.
        objective_fn (ObjectiveFn): Predicate evaluated after each step to set ``win``.
        entity (PMap[EntityID, Entity]): Registry of entity descriptors.
        immunity (PMap[EntityID, Immunity]): Effect component map.
        phasing (PMap[EntityID, Phasing]): Effect component map.
        speed (PMap[EntityID, Speed]): Effect component map.
        time_limit (PMap[EntityID, TimeLimit]): Effect limiter map (remaining steps).
        usage_limit (PMap[EntityID, UsageLimit]): Effect limiter map (remaining uses).
        agent (PMap[EntityID, Agent]): Player / AI controllable entity marker components.
        appearance (PMap[EntityID, Appearance]): Rendering metadata (glyph, layering, groups).
        blocking (PMap[EntityID, Blocking]): Entities that prevent movement into their tile.
        collectible (PMap[EntityID, Collectible]): Items that can be picked up.
        collidable (PMap[EntityID, Collidable]): Entities that can collide (triggering damage, cost, etc.).
        cost (PMap[EntityID, Cost]): Movement or interaction cost applied when entered.
        damage (PMap[EntityID, Damage]): Passive damage applied on collision / contact.
        dead (PMap[EntityID, Dead]): Marker for logically removed entities (awaiting GC).
        exit (PMap[EntityID, Exit]): Tiles that can satisfy the objective when conditions met.
        health (PMap[EntityID, Health]): Health pools for damage / lethal checks.
        inventory (PMap[EntityID, Inventory]): Item/key collections carried by entities.
        key (PMap[EntityID, Key]): Keys that can unlock ``Locked`` components.
        lethal_damage (PMap[EntityID, LethalDamage]): Immediate kill damage sources (pits, hazards).
        locked (PMap[EntityID, Locked]): Lock descriptors requiring matching keys.
        moving (PMap[EntityID, Moving]): Entities currently undergoing movement (inter-step state).
        pathfinding (PMap[EntityID, Pathfinding]): Agents with pathfinding goals and cached paths.

        required (PMap[EntityID, Required]): Items/conditions needed to satisfy Exit / objective.
        rewardable (PMap[EntityID, Rewardable]): Components conferring score rewards when collected or triggered.
        status (PMap[EntityID, Status]): Ordered list container referencing effect component ids.
        prev_position (PMap[EntityID, Position]): Snapshot of positions before movement this step.
        trail (PMap[Position, PSet[EntityID]]): Positions traversed this step mapped to entity ids.
        turn (int): Turn counter (0-based).
        score (int): Accumulated score.
        win (bool): True if objective met.
        lose (bool): True if losing condition met.
        message (str | None): Optional informational / terminal message.

"""Action enumerations.

Defines both the human readable :class:`Action` (string enum) used internally
and a stable integer :class:`GymAction` mapping for Gymnasium compatibility.

``MOVE_ACTIONS`` is the canonical ordered list of movement actions; checks like
``if action in MOVE_ACTIONS`` are preferred over enum name comparisons.

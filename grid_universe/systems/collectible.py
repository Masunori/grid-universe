"""Collectible system.

Resolves item/effect pickups and reward scoring when an entity occupies the
same tile as collectible entities. The system supports three pickup flows:

1. Effect pickup (power-up): adds an effect entity's ID to the entity's
    :class:`Status` if the effect is valid and not expired.
2. Inventory pickup: inserts keys, coins, cores, etc. into the entity's
    :class:`Inventory` (non-effect collectibles).
3. Reward scoring: applies immediate score changes for entities bearing a
    :class:`Rewardable` component (whether or not they are effect/inventory
    pickups) and removes them.

Collected entities are removed from ``position`` and ``collectible`` maps.
The system is idempotent for a given state+entity pairing.

"""Player (agent) movement system.

Attempts to move the controlled agent to ``next_pos`` applying effect logic:

1. If the agent has an active Phasing effect (consuming a usage/time limit) it
    ignores blocking components entirely.
2. Otherwise the move is allowed only if destination is in-bounds and not
    blocked by Blocking/Pushable/Collidable entities (push handling occurs in a
    separate system before this is called).

Returns the original ``State`` if movement is not possible; otherwise a new
``State`` with updated position (and possibly decremented usage limits).

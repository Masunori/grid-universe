Handles adjacent-tile interaction between an entity's inventory and any
neighboring locked objects. When the correct key is found, removes both the
``Locked`` and optional ``Blocking`` components so passage is opened. Keys
are single-use: they are removed from inventory (and key map) upon unlocking.
